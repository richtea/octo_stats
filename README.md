# Octopus Energy Tracking

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and other code to extract and display stats for Octopus Energy consumption and a
Zappi charger.

**NOTE** Before committing to this repo, add the [Git pre-commit hook](./pre-commit) by copying the `./pre-commit` file
into the `.git/hooks` subfolder (you may also need to run `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`). This hook prevents
committing Jupyter notebook outputs.
